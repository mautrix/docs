# mautrix-signal
Welcome to the mautrix-signal docs!

Use the sidebar to find the relevant pages. Things that are the same for all
bridges, like setting up the bridge, are right below the "Python-based bridges"
header. Things specific to mautrix-signal are under this page.

These docs are mostly targeted towards people who are hosting the bridge
themselves. If you don't want to host it yourself, you can use a public
instance. When using public instances, refer to their instructions and support
rooms.

* [beeper.com](https://www.beeper.com/) (paid service with lots of bridges)
* [tchncs.de](https://tchncs.de/matrix)
  / [#tchncs:tchncs.de](https://matrix.to/#/#tchncs:tchncs.de)
* [one.ems.host](https://element.io/element-one)
  / [#one:element.io](https://matrix.to/#/#one:element.io)
  (paid service with a few bridges, no end-to-bridge encryption)

If you run a public instance and wish to list it here, please [make a pull request](https://github.com/mautrix/docs/blob/master/bridges/python/signal/index.md).
