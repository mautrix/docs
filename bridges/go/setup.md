  <strong>
    The Google Messages bridge should be mostly functional, but it is still in
    early development and therefore will have bugs and may get breaking changes.
  </strong>
</p>

This page contains instructions for setting up the bridge by running the
executable yourself. You may also want to look at the other ways to run
the bridge:

* [Docker](../general/docker-setup.md)
* <span class="bridge-filter" bridges="whatsapp"></span> YunoHost:
  <a href="https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/mautrix_whatsapp_ynh">mautrix_whatsapp_ynh<span class="bridge-filter" bridges="whatsapp"></span></a>
* [systemd service](#systemd-service) (at the bottom of this page)

Please note that everything in these docs are meant for server admins who want
to self-host the bridge. If you're just looking to use the bridges, check out
[Beeper], which provides fully managed instances of all of these bridges.

If you need help with setting up the bridge, you can ask in the Matrix room:
[#$bridge:maunium.net](https://matrix.to/#/#$bridge:maunium.net). For help with
setting up other parts like the homeserver that aren't the bridge, refer to
their documentation to find support rooms.

## Requirements
* A Matrix homeserver that supports application services (e.g. [Synapse](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse)).
  You need access to register an appservice, which usually involves editing the homeserver config file.
* A PostgreSQL server, v10 or higher (which you should already have for Synapse).
  * Make sure you don't share databases between unrelated programs.
    Shared postgres instance is fine, but shared database is not.
* <span class="bridge-filter" bridges="whatsapp">**mautrix-whatsapp**: </span>
  A WhatsApp client running on a phone (both physical and virtual phones work).
* <span class="bridge-filter" bridges="whatsapp">**mautrix-whatsapp**: </span>
  ffmpeg (if you want to send gifs from Matrix).
* <span class="bridge-filter" bridges="discord">**mautrix-discord**: </span>
  [LottieConverter](https://github.com/sot-tech/LottieConverter) (If not installed and someone sending a gif it will crash)
* <span class="bridge-filter" bridges="discord">**mautrix-discord**: </span>
  ffmpeg (If not installed and someone sending a gif it will crash)

If you want to compile the bridge manually (which is not required), you'll also need:

* Go 1.20+ (download & installation instructions at <https://go.dev/doc/install>).
* libolm3 with dev headers and a C/C++ compiler (if you want end-to-bridge encryption).

## Installation
You may either compile the bridge manually or download a prebuilt executable
from the mau.dev CI or [GitHub releases](https://github.com/mautrix/$bridge/releases).
Prebuilt executables are the simplest option, as they don't require having Go
nor libolm installed.

### Downloading a prebuilt executable from CI
1. Go to <https://mau.dev/mautrix/$bridge/-/pipelines?scope=branches&page=1>
2. Find the entry for the `master` branch, click the download button on the
   right-hand side in the list and choose the architecture you want.
3. Extract the downloaded zip file into a new directory.

### Downloading a release
1. Go to <https://github.com/mautrix/$bridge/releases>
2. Download the binary for the architecture you want and save it in a new
   directory.

### Compiling manually
1. Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/mautrix/$bridge.git mautrix-$bridge`
2. Enter the directory (`cd mautrix-$bridge`)
3. Run `./build.sh` to fetch Go dependencies and compile
   ([`build.sh`] will simply call `go build` with some additional flags).
   * If you want end-to-bridge encryption, make sure you have a C/C++ compiler
     and the Olm dev headers (`libolm-dev` on debian-based distros) installed.
     Note that libolm3 is required, which means you have to use backports on
     Debian stable.
   * If not, use `./build.sh -tags nocrypto` to disable encryption.

[`build.sh`]: https://github.com/mautrix/$bridge/blob/master/build.sh

## Configuring and running
1. Copy `example-config.yaml` to `config.yaml`
2. Update the config to your liking. You'll at least need to change the
   homeserver settings, database address, and bridge permissions. If you miss
   something that's required, the bridge will refuse to start and tell you
   what's missing.
3. Generate the appservice registration file by running `./mautrix-$bridge -g`.
   * You can use the `-c` and `-r` flags to change the location of the config
     and registration files. They default to `config.yaml` and
     `registration.yaml` respectively.
4. Register the bridge on your homeserver (see [Registering appservices]).
5. Run the bridge with `./mautrix-$bridge`.

[Registering appservices]: ../general/registering-appservices.md

## Updating
If you compiled manually, pull changes with `git pull` and recompile with
`./build.sh`.

If you downloaded a prebuilt executable, simply download a new one and replace
the old one.

Finally, start the bridge again.

## systemd service
1. Create a user for the bridge:
   ```shell
   $ sudo adduser --system mautrix-$bridge --home /opt/mautrix-$bridge
   ```
2. Follow the normal setup instructions above.
   Make sure you use that user and home directory for the bridge.
4. Create a systemd service file at `/etc/systemd/system/mautrix-$bridge.service`:
   ```ini
   [Unit]
   Description=mautrix-$bridge bridge
   
   [Service]
   Type=exec
   User=mautrix-$bridge
   WorkingDirectory=/opt/mautrix-$bridge
   ExecStart=/opt/mautrix-$bridge/mautrix-$bridge
   Restart=on-failure
   RestartSec=30s
   
   # Optional hardening to improve security
