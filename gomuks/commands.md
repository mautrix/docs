# Commands
Most gomuks web commands can be discovered using autocompletion, with the
exception of a few special-cased commands: `/plain`, `/me`, `/notice`,
`/rainbow`, `/html` and `/unencrypted` will work even though they don't show
up in autocomplete.

The rest of this page only applies to gomuks legacy.

Tab-completing file paths is supported in all these commands.

outgoing requests via `/verify` work.
