# Installation

## Installing a package

The releases on GitHub contain binaries and debian
packages: <https://github.com/tulir/gomuks/releases>

GitLab CI builds binaries for each
commit: <https://mau.dev/tulir/gomuks/pipelines> (currently available for
linux/amd64, linux/arm, linux/arm64, darwin/amd64, darwin/arm64 and
windows/amd64).

The release and CI binaries for Linux and Windows are statically built and have
no dependencies at all. The binaries for macOS require installing libolm, either
with `brew install libolm` or by placing `libolm.3.dylib` from the CI in the
same directory as the `gomuks` binary.

There are also community maintained packages for several distributions. If
you've made a new distro package, please add it to the list below.

* Arch Linux (AUR): [gomuks](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gomuks),
  [gomuks-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gomuks-bin/), and
  [gomuks-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gomuks-git)
* NixOS: [gomuks](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/applications/networking/instant-messengers/gomuks/default.nix)
* OpenSUSE (OBS): [home:Dead_Mozay/gomuks](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:Dead_Mozay/gomuks)
* Alpine Linux: [gomuks](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=gomuks)
* macOS (Homebrew Tap): [aaronraimist/tap/gomuks](https://github.com/aaronraimist/homebrew-tap)
* macOS (MacPorts): [gomuks](https://ports.macports.org/port/gomuks)
* Windows (scoop): [gomuks](https://github.com/TheLastZombie/scoop-bucket/blob/master/bucket/gomuks.json)

## Compiling from source

0. Install [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) 1.18 or higher.
   * If you want end-to-end encryption, also install `libolm-dev`
     (3.x required, 2.x won't work) and C/C++ compilers.
   * If you don't want encryption, disable CGO with `export CGO_ENABLED=0`.
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/tulir/gomuks.git && cd gomuks`
2. Build: `./build.sh`
   ([build.sh] will simply call go build with some additional flags).

[build.sh]: https://github.com/tulir/gomuks/blob/master/build.sh
Simply pull changes (`git pull`) and run `go build` again to update.

### Common compilation issues
* `fatal error: olm/olm.h: No such file or directory` means you forgot to install libolm-dev,
  or that you installed it in a weird place which isn't in your default library lookup path.
  * In the latter case, set the `LIBRARY_PATH` and `CPATH` environment variables,
    e.g. `export LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib CPATH=/usr/local/include`.
* `fatal error: olm/pk.h: No such file or directory` means you installed libolm2 instead of libolm3.
* `cgo: C compiler "gcc" not found: exec: "gcc": executable file not found in $PATH` means you forgot to install C/C++ compilers.
* `//go:build comment without // +build comment` means your Go version is slightly outdated.
* `cannot load embed: malformed module path "embed"` or `package embed is not in GOROOT` means your Go version is very outdated.
* `cannot find package "maunium.net/go/gomuks/..." in any of:` usually means your Go version is extremely outdated.
