# Authentication

0. Open a private chat with the bridge bot. Usually `@instagrambot:your.server`
1. Send `login <email> <password>`
2. If you have 2FA enabled, the bot will ask you to send the 2FA code.
   If you don't have 2FA enabled, Instagram will likely ask you to confirm the
   login, in which case the bot will ask you to send the confirmation code.
3. Recent chats should now get portals automatically. Other chats will get
   portals as you receive messages.
